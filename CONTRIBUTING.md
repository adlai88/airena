# Contributing to Aryn

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Aryn as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests Welcome
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + React with Vercel AI SDK
- **Backend**: Vercel Edge Functions + Supabase (pgvector)
- **AI**: Supabase AI embeddings (384-dim) + GPT-4 generation + GPT-4V vision
- **Content**: Are.na API + Jina AI extraction + vision analysis
- **UI**: shadcn/ui design system with mobile-responsive foundation
- **Embeddings**: Supabase AI Session API (LW15 feature) - migrated from OpenAI
- **Authentication**: Better Auth with Supabase adapter
- **Billing**: Polar.sh for subscriptions

## Important Database Conventions

### Table Naming: SINGULAR (not plural)
**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Our database uses **SINGULAR** table names following Better Auth's convention:
- ‚úÖ `user` (NOT `users`)
- ‚úÖ `session` (NOT `sessions`)
- ‚úÖ `account` (NOT `accounts`)
- ‚úÖ `verification` (NOT `verifications`)

This is because Better Auth created these tables and uses singular naming. All new tables should follow this convention for consistency. DO NOT attempt to rename these tables to plural as it will break authentication.

### Database Changes
- Always use SINGULAR table names
- Create proper migrations
- Test with both auth systems during transition

## Architecture Highlights

### Authentication System
- **Better Auth** with Supabase adapter
- **Polar.sh** for billing and subscriptions
- **OAuth Support** ready for Google/GitHub providers
- Password reset functionality implemented

### Spatial Intelligence Canvas
- Transform Are.na channels into self-organizing knowledge maps
- Three-way view system: Grid, Similarity (semantic clusters), Random
- Advanced K-means++ clustering with cosine distance
- pgvector semantic analysis for block similarity
- tldraw integration for professional canvas experience

### Content Processing
- All 5 Are.na block types supported
- Multimodal processing: text, images, PDFs, videos, media
- YouTube transcript extraction
- PDF text extraction with page analysis
- GPT-4V for image understanding

## Getting Started

### Development Setup

```bash
# Fork and clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aryn.git
cd aryn

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your API keys and configuration

# Required for basic functionality:
# - DATABASE_URL (Supabase PostgreSQL with pgvector)
# - SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY 
# - BETTER_AUTH_SECRET (generate with: openssl rand -base64 32)
# - OPENAI_API_KEY (for chat completions)

# Optional for enhanced features:
# - ARENA_API_KEY (private channels)
# - YOUTUBE_API_KEY (better video processing)
# - JINA_API_KEY (enhanced web extraction)
# - POLAR_* (billing/subscriptions)

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Development server
npm run build        # Production build
npm run lint         # ESLint checking
npm run type-check   # TypeScript validation

# Testing commands
npm run test:setup   # Test API integrations
npm run test:arena   # Test Are.na client
npm run test:pipeline # Test sync pipeline
```

## Code Style

### TypeScript/JavaScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions

```typescript
/**
 * Extract content from an Are.na block
 * @param block - The Are.na block to process
 * @returns Processed block with extracted content
 */
async function processBlock(block: ArenaBlock): Promise<ProcessedBlock> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Props should have TypeScript interfaces
- Use shadcn/ui components when possible

```typescript
interface ChannelCardProps {
  channel: ArenaChannel;
  onSelect: (slug: string) => void;
}

export function ChannelCard({ channel, onSelect }: ChannelCardProps) {
  // Component implementation
}
```

### File Organization
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/              # Next.js pages and API routes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/       # Reusable React components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/              # Core business logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/            # Custom React hooks
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types/            # TypeScript type definitions
```
