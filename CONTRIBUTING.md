# Contributing to Airena

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Airena as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests Welcome
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Getting Started

### Development Setup

```bash
# Fork and clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/airena.git
cd airena

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your API keys

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Development server
npm run build        # Production build
npm run lint         # ESLint checking
npm run type-check   # TypeScript validation

# Testing commands
npm run test:setup   # Test API integrations
npm run test:arena   # Test Are.na client
npm run test:pipeline # Test sync pipeline
```

## Code Style

### TypeScript/JavaScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions

```typescript
/**
 * Extract content from an Are.na block
 * @param block - The Are.na block to process
 * @returns Processed block with extracted content
 */
async function processBlock(block: ArenaBlock): Promise<ProcessedBlock> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Props should have TypeScript interfaces
- Use shadcn/ui components when possible

```typescript
interface ChannelCardProps {
  channel: ArenaChannel;
  onSelect: (slug: string) => void;
}

export function ChannelCard({ channel, onSelect }: ChannelCardProps) {
  // Component implementation
}
```

### File Organization
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/              # Next.js pages and API routes
â”œâ”€â”€ components/       # Reusable React components
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/              # Core business logic
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/            # Custom React hooks
â””â”€â”€ types/            # TypeScript type definitions
```
