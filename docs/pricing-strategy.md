[Upgrade to Starter - Unlock Your Intelligence] [$5/month]
The Psychology
FOMO Creation: Shows specific, personalized value locked behind upgrade
Quantified Potential: Numbers make the upgrade value concrete
Non-Pushy: Presented as helpful insight, not aggressive sales
Curiosity Gap: Users want to know what insights their private channels contain
Technical Implementation
Are.na API: Fetch user's channel metadata (public info only)
Privacy Preserved: Only shows channel names/block counts, not content
Smart Analysis: Estimate content richness, topic diversity, generation potential
Personalized Messaging: Tailored based on their channel types and sizes
Conversion Impact
Before: "Maybe I'll upgrade someday"
After: "I have 1,247 blocks of research waiting to become intelligence"
This transforms abstract value proposition into concrete, personalized urgency.
