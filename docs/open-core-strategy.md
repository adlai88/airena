# Phase 10.2: Open Source Community Building Strategy

## Strategic Overview

**Goal**: Transform Airena from "open source with hosted convenience" to "intelligence discovery platform with professional upgrade path" leveraging Are.na's creative developer community.

**Key Insight**: The updated pricing model (free public channels + $5/$14 upgrades) creates a viral discovery engine that builds community through immediate value demonstration rather than traditional open source adoption barriers.

## Are.na Community Profile

**Target Audience Characteristics:**
- 37,678 paying Are.na premium subscribers ($5-45/month)
- Creative professionals: designers, artists, architects at Apple, Google, Tumblr, Dropbox
- "Connected knowledge collectors" who value intelligence throughout their day
- 80% use Are.na in both personal and professional contexts
- Universities: MIT, Yale, RISD, Parsons (academic early adopters)
- "Open Source by Default" philosophy - excited to see platform used in new ways

**Strategic Advantages:**
- Developer-friendly creatives who can evaluate both code quality AND curation value
- Premium mindset: already pay for quality tools
- Professional context: expense $5-14/month tools easily
- Cross-disciplinary: bridge design/development communities
