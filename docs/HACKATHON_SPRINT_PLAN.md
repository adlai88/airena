# üèÅ Aryn (Spatial Canvas for Airena) Hackathon Sprint Plan
**Deadline**: July 27, 2025 (Tomorrow!)  
**Current Time**: July 26, 2025  
**Available Hours**: ~6-8 hours  

## üéØ Strategic Goals
1. **Showcase Launch Week 15 Features** - Use Supabase's newest capabilities
2. **Polish UX** - Two-phase arrangement interaction 
3. **Technical Excellence** - Production-ready patterns
4. **Demo Impact** - Beautiful, working features that wow judges

## üìä Database Context
### Key Tables:
- **blocks**: Contains `embedding` field (vector type), thumbnails, content
- **channels**: Channel metadata with user associations
- **Edge Functions**: `analyze-clusters` already deployed for similarity view

### Current Features Working:
- ‚úÖ Spatial canvas with Grid/Similarity/Random views
- ‚úÖ K-means++ clustering with GPT-4 labels
- ‚úÖ Beautiful animations
- ‚úÖ Chat integration (but auto-executes arrangements)

## üöÄ Implementation Plan

### **Priority 1: Two-Phase Arrangement Interaction** (2-3 hours)
**Goal**: AI explains arrangement plan ‚Üí User clicks "Execute" ‚Üí Beautiful animation

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Add State Management** (30 mins)
   ```typescript
   // In SpatialCanvas.tsx
   const [pendingArrangement, setPendingArrangement] = useState<ArrangementData | null>(null)
   const [arrangementMessageId, setArrangementMessageId] = useState<string | null>(null)
   ```

2. **Modify Chat Response Handler** (45 mins)
   - Detect arrangement JSON but DON'T execute
   - Store in `pendingArrangement`
   - Add visual indicator to message

3. **Create Execute Button Component** (45 mins)
   ```typescript
   interface ExecuteArrangementButtonProps {
     arrangement: ArrangementData
     onExecute: () => void
     isExecuting: boolean
   }
   ```
   - Show in assistant messages with arrangements
   - Loading state during animation
   - "Rearrange" option after execution

4. **Integration & Testing** (30 mins)
   - Test with various arrangement commands
   - Ensure smooth animations
   - Handle edge cases

#### Success Metrics:
- [x] User sees AI explanation before arrangement
- [x] Clear "Execute Arrangement" button
- [x] Smooth animation on execution
- [ ] Can re-run or modify arrangements (stretch goal)

---

### **Priority 2: Supabase AI Session Integration** (1-2 hours)
**Goal**: Replace OpenAI embeddings with Supabase.ai.Session in Edge Function

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Update Edge Function** (45 mins)
   ```typescript
   // In analyze-clusters/index.ts
   const model = new Supabase.ai.Session('gte-small')
   const embedding = await model.run(content, {
     mean_pool: true,
     normalize: true,
   })
   ```

2. **Update Embedding Service** (30 mins)
   - Add fallback to Supabase AI if configured
   - Test embedding generation

3. **Deploy & Test** (15 mins)
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy analyze-clusters
   ```

#### Success Metrics:
- [x] Embeddings generated via Supabase AI (feature flag ready)
- [x] Performance comparable or better
- [x] Demo talking point ready (visible in X-Powered-By header)

---

### **Priority 3: Demo Script & Polish** (1 hour)
**Goal**: Highlight LW15 features prominently

#### Key Talking Points:
1. **Opening**: "Spatial intelligence powered by Supabase's newest Launch Week 15 features"
2. **During Sync**: "Using Supabase's new AI Session API for embeddings"
3. **During Chat**: "Two-phase arrangement for user control"
4. **Technical**: "Built with Edge Functions, pgvector, and real-time capabilities"

#### Polish Tasks:

## üöÄ LW15 Features Implementation Details

### **1. Supabase AI Session API**
**Location**: `supabase/functions/analyze-clusters/index.ts`
**Feature Flag**: `USE_SUPABASE_AI` environment variable

```typescript
// How we use it:
const model = new Supabase.ai.Session('gte-small')
const embedding = await model.run(text, {
  mean_pool: true,
  normalize: true,
})
```

**Benefits we're showcasing**:
- No external API keys needed (vs OpenAI)
- Native integration with Edge Functions
- Lower latency for embedding generation
- Cost-effective for hackathon demo

### **2. Edge Functions v2 (97% Faster Boot)**
**What we're using**:
- Native npm support (importing packages directly)
- Improved performance for clustering calculations
- Built-in CORS handling
- Environment variable support

### **3. pgvector Performance**
**How we leverage it**:
- Storing embeddings in `blocks.embedding` column
- Fast cosine similarity calculations
- Efficient K-means++ clustering on vectors

### **4. Custom Headers for Demo**
**X-Powered-By Header**: Shows which AI system is generating embeddings
- When `USE_SUPABASE_AI=true`: "Supabase AI Session (LW15)"
- When `USE_SUPABASE_AI=false`: "OpenAI"

## üé¨ Demo Script & Setup Guide

### **Pre-Demo Setup**

1. **Environment Configuration** (.env.local):
```bash
# Add this line to your .env.local file to enable Supabase AI embeddings
USE_SUPABASE_AI=true

# Make sure you also have these Supabase variables set
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

2. **Set the Environment Variable for Edge Functions**:
```bash
# Set the secret for your Supabase project
supabase secrets set USE_SUPABASE_AI=true

# Verify it's set
supabase secrets list
```

3. **Deploy Edge Function with Flag**:
```bash
# Deploy the function with the new environment variable
supabase functions deploy analyze-clusters --no-verify-jwt

# The function will now use Supabase AI instead of OpenAI
```
