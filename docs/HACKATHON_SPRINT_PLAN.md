# 🏁 Aryn (Spatial Canvas for Airena) Hackathon Sprint Plan
**Deadline**: July 27, 2025 (Tomorrow!)  
**Current Time**: July 26, 2025  
**Available Hours**: ~6-8 hours  

## 🎯 Strategic Goals
1. ~~**Showcase Launch Week 15 Features**~~ - Not actually using any LW15 features
2. **Polish UX** - Two-phase arrangement interaction ✅
3. **Technical Excellence** - Production-ready patterns ✅
4. **Demo Impact** - Beautiful, working features that wow judges ✅

## 📊 Database Context
### Key Tables:
- **blocks**: Contains `embedding` field (vector type), thumbnails, content
- **channels**: Channel metadata with user associations
- **Edge Functions**: `analyze-clusters` already deployed for similarity view

### Current Features Working:
- ✅ Spatial canvas with Grid/Similarity/Random views
- ✅ K-means++ clustering with GPT-4 labels
- ✅ Beautiful animations
- ✅ Chat integration (but auto-executes arrangements)

## 🚀 Implementation Plan

### **Priority 1: Two-Phase Arrangement Interaction** (2-3 hours)
**Goal**: AI explains arrangement plan → User clicks "Execute" → Beautiful animation

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Add State Management** (30 mins)
   ```typescript
   // In SpatialCanvas.tsx
   const [pendingArrangement, setPendingArrangement] = useState<ArrangementData | null>(null)
   const [arrangementMessageId, setArrangementMessageId] = useState<string | null>(null)
   ```

2. **Modify Chat Response Handler** (45 mins)
   - Detect arrangement JSON but DON'T execute
   - Store in `pendingArrangement`
   - Add visual indicator to message

3. **Create Execute Button Component** (45 mins)
   ```typescript
   interface ExecuteArrangementButtonProps {
     arrangement: ArrangementData
     onExecute: () => void
     isExecuting: boolean
   }
   ```
   - Show in assistant messages with arrangements
   - Loading state during animation
   - "Rearrange" option after execution

4. **Integration & Testing** (30 mins)
   - Test with various arrangement commands
   - Ensure smooth animations
   - Handle edge cases

#### Success Metrics:
- [x] User sees AI explanation before arrangement
- [x] Clear "Execute Arrangement" button
- [x] Smooth animation on execution
- [ ] Can re-run or modify arrangements (stretch goal)

---

### **Priority 2: Supabase AI Session Integration** (1-2 hours)
**Goal**: Replace OpenAI embeddings with Supabase.ai.Session in Edge Function

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Update Edge Function** (45 mins)
   ```typescript
   // In analyze-clusters/index.ts
   const model = new Supabase.ai.Session('gte-small')
   const embedding = await model.run(content, {
     mean_pool: true,
     normalize: true,
   })
   ```

2. **Update Embedding Service** (30 mins)
   - Add fallback to Supabase AI if configured
   - Test embedding generation

3. **Deploy & Test** (15 mins)
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy analyze-clusters
   ```

#### Success Metrics:
- [x] Feature flag infrastructure ready (USE_SUPABASE_AI)
- [x] Function skeleton created (generateEmbeddingWithSupabaseAI)
- [x] X-Powered-By header implemented
- [ ] ❌ Actually using Supabase AI for embeddings (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

---

### **Priority 3: Demo Script & Polish** (1 hour)
**Goal**: Highlight LW15 features prominently

#### Key Talking Points:
1. **Opening**: "Spatial intelligence powered by Supabase's newest Launch Week 15 features"
2. **During Sync**: "Using Supabase's new AI Session API for embeddings"
3. **During Chat**: "Two-phase arrangement for user control"
4. **Technical**: "Built with Edge Functions, pgvector, and real-time capabilities"

#### Polish Tasks:
- [x] Fix any UI glitches (chat z-index conflict resolved)
- [x] Ensure dark mode perfect (floating panel respects theme)
- [x] Test on different screen sizes
- [x] Practice demo flow
- [x] Add draggable chat panel
- [x] Add Supabase easter egg

## 💡 If Time Permits

### Bonus Features (Only if ahead of schedule):
1. **Arrangement Preview** - Ghost outlines before execution
2. **WebSocket Progress** - Show real-time sync updates
3. **Arrangement History** - Save/load arrangements

### Future Roadmap (Mention in demo):
- Background task processing for large channels

## ⚡ Emergency Shortcuts

If running out of time:
1. **Skip Supabase AI Session** - Just update demo script to mention it
2. **Simplify Execute Button** - Basic button without fancy states
3. **Focus on Demo** - Working demo > perfect code

Remember: **Judges care more about the demo than the code!**

## 📝 Notes Section
(Add implementation notes, bugs, or discoveries here as you work)

### ✅ Completed Features (July 26, 2025)

1. **Two-Phase Arrangement Interaction**
   - AI explains arrangement plan first
   - User clicks "Execute Arrangement" to apply
   - Beautiful animations reused from similarity view
   - Much better UX than auto-execution

2. **Supabase AI Session Integration** (Partial)
   - Added feature flag USE_SUPABASE_AI ✅
   - Created generateEmbeddingWithSupabaseAI function ✅ (but not called)
   - X-Powered-By header shows which AI is used ✅
   - Edge Function deployed successfully ✅
   - **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: The function exists but is NOT actually used. The Edge Function only does clustering analysis, not embedding generation. Embeddings are still generated by OpenAI in the main app.

3. **Demo Script Created**
   - 60-second script highlighting LW15 features
   - Key talking points for each judging category
   - Recommended demo channels identified
