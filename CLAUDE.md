## üöÄ **Next Phase: Phase 10.6 - Clerk ‚Üí Polar Auth Migration**

### **Strategic Rationale**
With zero existing users and potential hackathon traffic incoming, now is the perfect time to migrate from dual auth/billing systems to Polar's unified solution.

### **Migration Benefits**
1. **Single system** for authentication + billing
2. **Works in development** without special Clerk setup
3. **Simpler architecture** - no metadata syncing between systems
4. **Better user tracking** from day one
5. **Reduced complexity** - one less service dependency

### **Planned Approach**
1. **Require authentication** for all users (no more anonymous access complexity)
2. **Use Polar OAuth** for sign up/sign in
3. **Direct integration** - user data and subscription in one place
4. **Update messaging** - "Free to start" instead of "No signup required"

### **Timeline**
- After spatial canvas is merged and deployed
- Complete before major user acquisition begins
- Test thoroughly with the single existing user (you!)

## üöÄ **Previous Phase: Phase 10.4d - Template Enhancement + System Testing**

**Strategic Timing**: With user experience polished, focus on immediate value-add features before complex intelligence scoring.

### üéØ **Current Priorities**

#### **Immediate (Week 1-2)**
1. **Test monthly reset system** - ensure existing monthly limits work correctly
2. **Activate brainstorm template** - enable creative free tier template
3. **Plan enhanced research report** - design Firecrawl integration for premium tier

#### **Development Focus (Week 2-4)** 
- **Template Priority 1**: Activate brainstorm template for free tier (encourages creativity)
- **Template Priority 2**: Enhanced research report with Firecrawl integration (premium justification)
- **System validation** - monthly reset testing before any weekly reset implementation

### üöß **Template Enhancement Strategy**

#### **üìã Template Implementation Plan**

**Free Tier Template**: Brainstorm Template

#### **üìä Reset System Testing Requirements**

**Monthly Reset System** (currently implemented but untested):
- **Free Tier**: 10 chat messages + 2 generations per channel per month
- **Starter Tier**: 200 blocks per month (unlimited chat/generations)
- **Pro Tier**: 500 blocks per month (unlimited chat/generations)

**Weekly Reset System** (future implementation):
- **Only needed for new free tier strategy**: 1 channel, 25 blocks total, weekly reset
- **Current priority**: Test monthly resets first

### üöß Phase 10.4e: Intelligence Score Foundation (LATER)

#### **üîÆ Core Intelligence Score Feature**
Based on pricing strategy: *"Shows specific, personalized value locked behind upgrade"*

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] **Are.na account analysis API** - fetch user's private channel metadata
- [ ] **Intelligence Score calculation** - analyze channel richness, topic diversity

## üîê Phase 10.6: Authentication Migration - Clerk to Polar

### Current Auth Architecture (Clerk)

**Key Integration Points:**
1. **Middleware** (`src/middleware.ts`)
   - Protects routes using `clerkMiddleware()`
   - Public routes: home, setup, pricing, legal pages, API routes
   - Protected routes: channels, generate, usage, settings

2. **User Management**
   - Users table synced via Clerk webhooks (`/api/webhooks/clerk`)
   - User ID mapping: `clerk_user_id` ‚Üí `users.id`
   - Email and metadata stored locally

3. **Auth Hooks & Components**
   - `useAuth()` hook used throughout for user state
   - `SignIn`/`SignUp` components from `@clerk/nextjs`
   - `UserButton` for account management

4. **API Protection**
   - Routes check `auth().userId` for authentication
   - User lookup via `clerk_user_id` in database

5. **Key Dependencies**
   - `@clerk/nextjs`: UI components and hooks
   - Clerk environment variables: `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_*`, `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`

### Known Issues to Address

1. **Unauthenticated Sync Bug**
   - New/unauthenticated users can't sync channels
   - Error: "User not found" in sync endpoint
   - Need to handle guest/anonymous syncing

2. **User Data Migration**
   - Only 1 user currently (makes migration simpler)
   - Need to map Clerk user ID to Polar customer ID

### Polar Integration Considerations

**What we know:**
- Polar already handles payments/subscriptions
- Has customer portal for subscription management
- Email-based customer identification
- Need to review Polar's auth capabilities

**Migration Strategy (High-Level):**
1. Review Polar auth documentation
2. Create migration plan preserving existing user data
3. Update middleware and auth checks
4. Replace Clerk components with Polar equivalents
5. Update API endpoints to use Polar auth
6. Test thoroughly with existing user account

**Database Considerations:**
- Add `polar_customer_id` to users table
- Maintain `clerk_user_id` during transition
- Eventually remove Clerk fields after migration
