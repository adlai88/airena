# Airena v2 - Active Development Plan

## Project Overview

Airena transforms curated Are.na channels into an intelligence agent that generates content from your own research. Instead of searching through bookmarks manually, users can generate newsletters, reports, and insights using AI powered by their personally curated content.

## ðŸš€ **Next Phase: Phase 10.4c - Intelligence Score Development**

**Strategic Timing**: With security vulnerabilities resolved and discovery system in place, focus on advanced features that drive engagement and retention.

### ðŸŽ¯ **Current Priorities**

#### **Immediate (Week 1-2)**
1. **Monitor system stability** - ensure tiered discovery system performs well under load
2. **User feedback collection** - gather insights on new channel discovery experience
3. **Intelligence Score research** - Are.na API capabilities, personalization algorithms

#### **Development Focus (Week 2-4)** 
- **Intelligence Score MVP** - personalized content analysis and recommendations
- **Enhanced analytics** - user engagement tracking and optimization
- **Performance monitoring** - ensure new features don't impact sync speeds

### ðŸš§ Phase 10.4c: Intelligence Score Foundation (NEXT)

#### **ðŸ”® Core Intelligence Score Feature**
Based on pricing strategy: *"Shows specific, personalized value locked behind upgrade"*

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] **Are.na account analysis API** - fetch user's private channel metadata
- [ ] **Intelligence Score calculation** - analyze channel richness, topic diversity
- [ ] **Personalized upgrade preview** - show potential newsletters, report count
- [ ] **Privacy-first design** - metadata only, no content access
- [ ] **Upgrade flow integration** - seamless transition to Starter tier

#### **ðŸ“Š Intelligence Score Display Components**
```
ðŸ”® Your Intelligence Potential
ðŸ“Š Private Channels Detected: 8 channels, 1,247 total blocks
ðŸŽ¯ High-Value Channels:
   â€¢ "Design Research" (347 blocks) â†’ 14 potential newsletters
   â€¢ "AI Papers" (298 blocks) â†’ High knowledge density
ðŸ’¡ Intelligence Coverage: 12 topics
ðŸš€ Upgrade Impact: 50x more content available
```

#### **ðŸŽ¯ Conversion Psychology Elements**
- **FOMO Creation**: Specific, personalized value locked behind upgrade
- **Quantified Potential**: Numbers make upgrade value concrete  
- **Curiosity Gap**: Users want to know what insights their channels contain
- **Non-Pushy Presentation**: Helpful insight, not aggressive sales

### ðŸš§ Phase 10.4c: Enhanced Free Tier (LATER)

#### **ðŸ“ˆ New Free Tier Strategy**
**Current**: 3 channels, 25 blocks per channel, chat only
**New**: 1 channel, 25 blocks total, weekly reset + 1 generation/week

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] **Weekly reset system** - habit formation mechanics
- [ ] **Generation limit tracking** - 1 generation per week for free users  
- [ ] **Enhanced generation templates** - newsletters, insights, reports
- [ ] **Weekly engagement emails** - remind users when reset occurs

### ðŸ›  Technical Implementation Strategy

#### **Phase 10.4a: Open Source (1-2 days)**
1. Add LICENSE file and update package.json
2. Test self-hosting end-to-end with fresh setup
3. Make repository public
4. Launch on communities (r/MachineLearning, Are.na, etc.)

#### **Phase 10.4b: Intelligence Score (1-2 weeks)**  
1. **Week 1**: Are.na API integration + scoring algorithm
2. **Week 2**: UI components + upgrade flow integration

#### **Phase 10.4c: Enhanced Free Tier (1 week)**
