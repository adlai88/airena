# Airena v2 - Active Development Plan

## Project Overview

Airena transforms curated Are.na channels into an intelligence agent that generates content from your own research. Instead of searching through bookmarks manually, users can generate newsletters, reports, and insights using AI powered by their personally curated content.

**Core Value**: Your curation advantage becomes your intelligence advantage.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + React with Vercel AI SDK
- **Backend**: Vercel Edge Functions + Supabase (pgvector)
- **AI**: OpenAI embeddings + GPT-4 generation + GPT-4V vision
- **Content**: Are.na API + Jina AI extraction + vision analysis
- **UI**: shadcn/ui design system with mobile-responsive foundation

âœ… **MVP Features Complete**  
âœ… **Professional UI with shadcn/ui**  
âœ… **Image processing with GPT-4V**  
âœ… **Intelligent curation companion**  
âœ… **Successfully deployed to Vercel**  
ðŸ”„ **Phase 9: Mobile Experience Finesse** (IN PROGRESS - MVP-focused mobile optimization)
ðŸ”„ **Phase 10: Open Source Strategy + Monetization** (AFTER - Community-driven growth)

**Live Application**: https://airena-mu.vercel.app/

## Where We Are

**Production-ready MVP with all core features working end-to-end:**
- **Are.na Integration**: Full channel sync with Link + Image block processing
- **AI Pipeline**: OpenAI embeddings + GPT-4 generation + GPT-4V vision analysis  
- **User Experience**: Professional shadcn/ui design with responsive foundation
- **Intelligence Layer**: Smart curation companion that never shuts down users
- **Deployment**: Live on Vercel with Supabase backend

**What's Next**: Two-phase approach prioritizing user experience before monetization:
1. **Phase 9 (Mobile)**: Polish the responsive foundation for Are.na's mobile-heavy user base
2. **Phase 10 (Open Source)**: Launch community-driven growth with $9/$19/$99 pricing tiers

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 9: Mobile Experience Finesse âœ… **NEXT PRIORITY**

### Goals & Context
**Why Mobile First**: Are.na's user base is heavily mobile-focused, and we have a solid responsive foundation with shadcn/ui. These are polish optimizations rather than major rewrites, making this the logical next step before open source launch.

**Strategic Timing**: Complete mobile polish while the codebase is still simple, before adding monetization complexity. This ensures community sees the best possible experience when we launch open source.

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 9.1: Mobile Navigation & Interaction âœ… **COMPLETED**
**Goal**: Optimize touch interactions and navigation flow
- [x] **Touch interaction audit** - Audited navigation.tsx component for mobile issues
- [x] **Tab navigation enhancement** - Added 44px min-height, responsive text sizing (`text-sm sm:text-base`), optimized touch padding (`px-3 sm:px-4`), improved container width (`max-w-sm sm:max-w-md`)
- [x] **Mobile keyboard optimization** - Added auto-scroll, viewport handling, input focus management, mobile keyboard attributes
- [ ] **Navigation timing** - Reduce perceived load times with optimistic navigation

**Changes made**: 
- Updated `/src/components/navigation.tsx` with mobile-optimized tab dimensions, responsive typography, and compact mobile layout (reduced padding, smaller text/icons, tighter spacing)
- Enhanced `/src/app/chat/page.tsx` with mobile keyboard optimizations: auto-scroll to bottom, viewport resize handling, proper input attributes for mobile keyboards
- Fixed navigation crowding on mobile: reduced padding (`px-2`), smaller tabs (`text-xs`), compact avatar (`h-7 w-7`), tighter gaps
- Improved setup page layout: changed from narrow to standard container width, increased max-width to `max-w-2xl` for better mobile usability
- Added native sharing to `/src/app/generate/page.tsx` - Web Share API with clipboard fallback for generated content
- Added sharing buttons to `/src/app/chat/page.tsx` - Share individual assistant responses with mobile share sheet
- Added proper SSR safety checks for all browser APIs (`typeof navigator !== 'undefined'`, `typeof window !== 'undefined'`)

#### Phase 9.2: Essential Mobile Features (MVP-Focused) âœ… **IN PROGRESS**
**Goal**: High-impact mobile functionality for core user flows
- [x] **Native sharing integration** - iOS/Android share sheet for generated content (high value for Are.na users)
- [ ] **Basic gesture support** - Swipe between tabs (if easy to implement)

#### Phase 9.3: Core Performance & Responsiveness (MVP-Focused)
**Goal**: Essential mobile UX optimizations that affect every interaction
- [ ] **Touch responsiveness** - Eliminate 300ms tap delay, improve scroll performance
- [ ] **Mobile loading performance** - Basic lazy loading, optimize critical rendering path
- [ ] **Keyboard handling** - Better mobile keyboard behavior in chat interface

#### Post-MVP Mobile Features (Phase 11+)
**Deferred until after open source launch:**
- Progressive Web App (PWA) features
- Haptic feedback and voice input
- Offline capability and advanced caching
- Bundle size optimization and image format optimization
- Memory optimization and advanced performance tuning

### Mobile-First Design Considerations

**Screen Size Optimization:**
- **320px (iPhone SE)**: Minimum viable layout
- **375px (iPhone 12/13)**: Primary design target
- **414px (iPhone Pro Max)**: Enhanced layout utilization
- **768px+ (iPad)**: Tablet-optimized interface

**Are.na Mobile User Patterns:**
- **Discovery-first**: Mobile users browse and discover more than desktop
- **Quick interactions**: Generate content on-the-go, read later
- **Sharing-heavy**: Mobile users share generated content more frequently
- **Attention-sensitive**: Shorter attention spans, need faster feedback

### Success Criteria
- **Performance**: < 2s load time on 3G networks
- **Interaction**: All touch targets â‰¥ 44px, smooth 60fps animations
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader compatible, high contrast support
- **User Experience**: Intuitive mobile-first navigation, minimal friction

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 10: Open Source Strategy + Monetization âœ… **AFTER MOBILE**

### Goals & Strategic Context
**Why After Mobile**: Launch open source with the best possible user experience. Mobile polish ensures community's first impression is professional and polished.

**Strategic Approach**: Open Core Model - open source the intelligence layer, monetize the infrastructure layer. This builds community trust while creating sustainable revenue.

### Implementation Phases
