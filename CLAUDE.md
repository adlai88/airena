# Airena v2 - Active Development Plan

## Project Overview

Airena transforms curated Are.na channels into an intelligence agent that generates content from your own research. Instead of searching through bookmarks manually, users can generate newsletters, reports, and insights using AI powered by their personally curated content.

**Core Value**: Your curation advantage becomes your intelligence advantage.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + React with Vercel AI SDK
- **Backend**: Vercel Edge Functions + Supabase (pgvector)
- **AI**: OpenAI embeddings + GPT-4 generation + GPT-4V vision
- **Content**: Are.na API + Jina AI extraction + vision analysis
- **UI**: shadcn/ui design system with mobile-responsive foundation

🚧 **Phase 10.4: Open Source Launch + Intelligence Score** (IN PROGRESS - Community building + conversion optimization)
🎯 **Latest Focus**: Open source launch for community building, then Intelligence Score for enhanced conversions

**Live Application**: https://www.airena.io/

## Latest Updates (Phase 10.4: Open Source Launch + Intelligence Score)

### 🎯 Strategic Overview
**Goal**: Build community through open source launch, then implement Intelligence Score for enhanced conversions based on new pricing strategy (see `docs/pricing-strategy.md`)

**Key Strategy Shift**: 
- Open source first → community building & validation
- Intelligence Score second → conversion optimization
- MCP server later → after proven demand

### 🚧 Phase 10.4a: Open Source Launch (PRIORITY)

#### **✅ Documentation Foundation (COMPLETED)**
- **README.md**: Comprehensive guide with both hosted & self-hosted paths
- **docs/SELF_HOSTING.md**: Production-ready setup instructions
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Professional contributor guidelines
- **.env.example**: Detailed configuration with cost estimates

#### **🎯 Launch Preparation (IN PROGRESS)**
- [ ] **Add LICENSE file** (MIT recommended for maximum adoption)
- [ ] **Update package.json** (repository URL, license field)  
- [ ] **Test self-hosting process** with fresh Supabase instance
- [ ] **Make GitHub repository public**
- [ ] **Launch announcement** on relevant communities

#### **📋 Self-Hosting Validation Checklist**
- [ ] Fresh Supabase project setup from scratch
- [ ] All environment variables working correctly
- [ ] Database migrations running successfully
- [ ] Public channel processing functional
- [ ] Generation and chat features working

### 🚧 Phase 10.4b: Intelligence Score Foundation (NEXT)

#### **🔮 Core Intelligence Score Feature**
Based on pricing strategy: *"Shows specific, personalized value locked behind upgrade"*

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] **Are.na account analysis API** - fetch user's private channel metadata
- [ ] **Intelligence Score calculation** - analyze channel richness, topic diversity
- [ ] **Personalized upgrade preview** - show potential newsletters, report count
- [ ] **Privacy-first design** - metadata only, no content access
- [ ] **Upgrade flow integration** - seamless transition to Starter tier

#### **📊 Intelligence Score Display Components**
```
🔮 Your Intelligence Potential
📊 Private Channels Detected: 8 channels, 1,247 total blocks
🎯 High-Value Channels:
   • "Design Research" (347 blocks) → 14 potential newsletters
   • "AI Papers" (298 blocks) → High knowledge density
💡 Intelligence Coverage: 12 topics
🚀 Upgrade Impact: 50x more content available
```

#### **🎯 Conversion Psychology Elements**
- **FOMO Creation**: Specific, personalized value locked behind upgrade
- **Quantified Potential**: Numbers make upgrade value concrete  
- **Curiosity Gap**: Users want to know what insights their channels contain
- **Non-Pushy Presentation**: Helpful insight, not aggressive sales

### 🚧 Phase 10.4c: Enhanced Free Tier (LATER)

#### **📈 New Free Tier Strategy**
**Current**: 3 channels, 25 blocks per channel, chat only
**New**: 1 channel, 25 blocks total, weekly reset + 1 generation/week

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] **Weekly reset system** - habit formation mechanics
- [ ] **Generation limit tracking** - 1 generation per week for free users  
- [ ] **Enhanced generation templates** - newsletters, insights, reports
- [ ] **Weekly engagement emails** - remind users when reset occurs

### 🛠 Technical Implementation Strategy

#### **Phase 10.4a: Open Source (1-2 days)**
1. Add LICENSE file and update package.json
2. Test self-hosting end-to-end with fresh setup
3. Make repository public
4. Launch on communities (r/MachineLearning, Are.na, etc.)

#### **Phase 10.4b: Intelligence Score (1-2 weeks)**  
1. **Week 1**: Are.na API integration + scoring algorithm
2. **Week 2**: UI components + upgrade flow integration

#### **Phase 10.4c: Enhanced Free Tier (1 week)**
1. Weekly reset infrastructure  
2. Generation templates and limits
3. Engagement mechanics

### 📊 Success Metrics

**Open Source Launch:**
- GitHub stars and forks growth
- Community discussions and contributions
- Self-hosting adoption feedback

**Intelligence Score:**
- Free → Starter conversion rate improvement (target: >25%)
- User engagement with Intelligence Score feature
- Upgrade click-through rates

**Enhanced Free Tier:**
- Weekly return visit rates
- Generation feature adoption
