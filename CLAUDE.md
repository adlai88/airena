# Aryn v2 - Open Source Project

## Project Overview

Aryn transforms curated Are.na channels into an intelligence agent that generates content from your own research. Instead of searching through bookmarks manually, users can generate newsletters, reports, and insights using AI powered by their personally curated content.

**Core Value**: Your curation advantage becomes your intelligence advantage.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + React with Vercel AI SDK
- **Backend**: Vercel Edge Functions + Supabase (pgvector)
- **AI**: Supabase AI embeddings (384-dim) + GPT-4 generation + GPT-4V vision
- **Content**: Are.na API + Jina AI extraction + vision analysis
- **UI**: shadcn/ui design system with mobile-responsive foundation
- **Embeddings**: Supabase AI Session API (LW15 feature) - migrated from OpenAI

## Important Database Conventions

### Table Naming: SINGULAR (not plural)
**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Our database uses **SINGULAR** table names following Better Auth's convention:
- ‚úÖ `user` (NOT `users`)
- ‚úÖ `session` (NOT `sessions`)
- ‚úÖ `account` (NOT `accounts`)
- ‚úÖ `verification` (NOT `verifications`)

This is because Better Auth created these tables and uses singular naming. All new tables should follow this convention for consistency. DO NOT attempt to rename these tables to plural as it will break authentication.

## Architecture Highlights

### Authentication System
- **Better Auth** with Supabase adapter
- **Polar.sh** for billing and subscriptions
- **OAuth Support** ready for Google/GitHub providers
- Password reset functionality implemented

### Spatial Intelligence Canvas
- Transform Are.na channels into self-organizing knowledge maps
- Three-way view system: Grid, Similarity (semantic clusters), Random
- Advanced K-means++ clustering with cosine distance
- pgvector semantic analysis for block similarity
- tldraw integration for professional canvas experience

### Content Processing
- All 5 Are.na block types supported
- Multimodal processing: text, images, PDFs, videos, media
- YouTube transcript extraction
- PDF text extraction with page analysis
- GPT-4V for image understanding

## Task Management

We use Linear for project management and issue tracking. Check the Linear workspace for active issues and priorities.

## Contributing Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Leverage existing utilities and libraries
- Maintain responsive design principles

### Database Changes
- Always use SINGULAR table names
- Create proper migrations
- Test with both auth systems during transition

### Testing
- Verify changes work with Better Auth
- Test subscription flows with Polar
- Ensure mobile responsiveness

## Self-Hosting
