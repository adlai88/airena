# Aryn v2 - Open Source Project

## Project Overview

Aryn transforms curated Are.na channels into an intelligence agent that generates content from your own research. Instead of searching through bookmarks manually, users can generate newsletters, reports, and insights using AI powered by their personally curated content.

**Core Value**: Your curation advantage becomes your intelligence advantage.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + React with Vercel AI SDK
- **Backend**: Vercel Edge Functions + Supabase (pgvector)
- **AI**: Supabase AI embeddings (384-dim) + GPT-4 generation + GPT-4V vision
- **Content**: Are.na API + Jina AI extraction + vision analysis
- **UI**: shadcn/ui design system with mobile-responsive foundation
- **Embeddings**: Supabase AI Session API (LW15 feature) - migrated from OpenAI

## Important Database Conventions

### Table Naming: SINGULAR (not plural)
**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Our database uses **SINGULAR** table names following Better Auth's convention:
- ✅ `user` (NOT `users`)
- ✅ `session` (NOT `sessions`)
- ✅ `account` (NOT `accounts`)
- ✅ `verification` (NOT `verifications`)

This is because Better Auth created these tables and uses singular naming. All new tables should follow this convention for consistency. DO NOT attempt to rename these tables to plural as it will break authentication.

## Important Instruction Reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.

## 🚀 Current Phase: Phase 11 - Post-Hackathon Growth & Polish

**Strategic Timing**: After winning the hackathon 🏆, leverage the momentum for growth features and user engagement improvements.

### 🎯 Current Priorities

#### Immediate (Week 1)
1. **Monitor founding member signups** - track waitlist growth and engagement
2. **Test lifetime block limits** - ensure 50-block free tier works correctly

#### Growth Features (Week 2-3)
- **Enhanced research report** - with web search integration (premium value)
- **OAuth Integration**: Add Google/GitHub login for easier onboarding
- **Email Service**: Set up Resend for password resets and notifications

### 🚧 Template Enhancement Strategy

#### 📋 Template Implementation Plan

**Premium Tier Template**: Enhanced Research Report
- **Current Status**: Basic version exists, needs Firecrawl integration
- **Function**: Combines curated content with intelligent web research
- **Value**: Transforms static curation into dynamic research assistant
- **Implementation**: See `/_ai-docs/enhanced-research-report-template.md`

#### 📊 Reset System Testing Requirements

**Monthly Reset System** (currently implemented but untested):
- **Free Tier**: 10 chat messages + 2 generations per channel per month
- **Starter Tier**: 200 blocks per month (unlimited chat/generations)
- **Pro Tier**: 500 blocks per month (unlimited chat/generations)

**Weekly Reset System** (future implementation):
- **Only needed for new free tier strategy**: 1 channel, 25 blocks total, weekly reset
- **Current priority**: Test monthly resets first

### 🚧 Phase 10.4e: Intelligence Score Foundation (LATER)

#### 🔮 Core Intelligence Score Feature
Based on pricing strategy: *"Shows specific, personalized value locked behind upgrade"*

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] **Are.na account analysis API** - fetch user's private channel metadata
- [ ] **Intelligence Score calculation** - analyze channel richness, topic diversity
- [ ] **Personalized upgrade preview** - show potential newsletters, report count
- [ ] **Privacy-first design** - metadata only, no content access
- [ ] **Upgrade flow integration** - seamless transition to Starter tier

#### 📊 Intelligence Score Display Components
```
🔮 Your Intelligence Potential
📊 Private Channels Detected: 8 channels, 1,247 total blocks
🎯 High-Value Channels:
   • "Design Research" (347 blocks) → 14 potential newsletters
   • "AI Papers" (298 blocks) → High knowledge density
💡 Intelligence Coverage: 12 topics
🚀 Upgrade Impact: 50x more content available
```

#### 🎯 Conversion Psychology Elements
- **FOMO Creation**: Specific, personalized value locked behind upgrade
- **Quantified Potential**: Numbers make upgrade value concrete  
- **Curiosity Gap**: Users want to know what insights their channels contain
- **Non-Pushy Presentation**: Helpful insight, not aggressive sales

### 🚧 Phase 10.4c: Enhanced Free Tier (LATER)

#### 📈 New Free Tier Strategy
**Current**: 3 channels, 25 blocks per channel, chat only
**New**: 1 channel, 25 blocks total, weekly reset + 1 generation/week

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] **Weekly reset system** - habit formation mechanics
- [ ] **Generation limit tracking** - 1 generation per week for free users  
- [ ] **Enhanced generation templates** - newsletters, insights, reports
- [ ] **Weekly engagement emails** - remind users when reset occurs

## 🎯 Current Pricing Structure

## ⚠️ TEMPORARY: Usage Caps Disabled (July 26, 2025)

**Context**: All usage limits and tracking have been temporarily disabled to allow for pricing restructure planning.

**What's Disabled**:
1. **Block processing limits** - No 25-block free tier limit
2. **Channel count limits** - No 3-channel free tier limit
3. **Chat message limits** - No 10 messages/month limit
4. **Generation limits** - No 2 generations/month limit
5. **Usage tracking** - No recording of usage to database

**Files Modified** (search for "TEMPORARILY DISABLED"):
- `/src/lib/sync.ts` - Block and channel limit checks bypassed
- `/src/app/api/chat/route.ts` - Chat limits and recording bypassed
- `/src/app/api/generate/route.ts` - Generation limits and recording bypassed

**ESLint Suppressions Added**:
- Unused variables (`userId`, `userSessionId`, `UsageTracker`) have eslint-disable comments

**To Re-enable**:
1. Search codebase for "TEMPORARILY DISABLED"
2. Uncomment the original code blocks
3. Remove the temporary mock `usageInfo` object
4. Remove eslint-disable comments for the variables
5. Test all limit enforcement and recording

**Why**: User reported being on Starter plan but system treating as Free tier. Decision made to disable all caps while redesigning pricing structure.

## 🐛 Known Issues & Edge Cases

### Lifetime Blocks Can Exceed Limit
**Issue**: Users can end up with more lifetime_blocks_used than their limit (e.g., 94/50)
**Cause**: Failed sync attempts may still record block usage, or multiple concurrent syncs could exceed the limit
**Impact**: UI shows confusing numbers like "94/50 (0 remaining)"
**TODO**: Add database constraint or application logic to prevent lifetime_blocks_used from exceeding 50 for free tier

**Temporary Fix**: Reset user's blocks via SQL:
```sql
UPDATE "user" 
SET lifetime_blocks_used = 0
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

## 📧 Future Enhancements

### Email Service for Password Reset (Resend)
Currently, password reset emails are only logged to console in development. To enable actual email delivery in production:

1. **Sign up for Resend** at https://resend.com
2. **Verify your domain** (aryn.im) in Resend dashboard
3. **Get your API key** from Resend
4. **Add to Vercel environment variables**:
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` = your-resend-api-key
   - `NODE_ENV` = production

The code is already set up to use Resend when the API key is present. This will enable:
- Password reset emails
- Future: Welcome emails, notification emails, weekly digests

### Image Generation in Spatial Canvas
Future enhancement idea for the spatial canvas: Allow users to generate new images using existing blocks as visual references.

**Interaction concept:**
- User selects multiple image blocks on the canvas
- Opens a generation panel showing selected images as references
- User provides text prompt (e.g., "combine these aesthetics into a new mood board image")
- System generates new images that blend visual elements from references
- Generated images appear on canvas and can be saved back to Are.na

**Technical considerations:**
- Use image-to-image generation APIs (DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion XL, Midjourney)
- Extract style characteristics (colors, composition, textures) from source images
- Leverage existing embeddings for semantic understanding
- Support iterative refinement and variations
- Enable mask/inpainting for combining specific elements

This would transform the spatial canvas from an organizational tool into a generative creative companion, extending the "curation to creation" philosophy.
